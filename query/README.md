# SolarQuery Proxy

This directory contains setup configuration for the SolarQuery proxy server. The entire contents of
the `freebsd/` directory is meant to be tarred up and extracted on a new EC2 instance to provide the
initial configuration. Files ending in `.tmpl` are templates that need to be integrated into the
corresponding file whose name omits the `.tmpl` suffix.
